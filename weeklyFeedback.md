#Weekly Feedback

##WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?
* Again, I found the live coding to be extremely useful and then the implementation of the code in lab time helped solidify what was going on.
* Working Social Framework and Twitter API. Use of switch statement to handle server response codes. First time I remember building a xib file, will definitely be doing some template work with these. Good changes in response to first week feedback, appreciate it.
* The lab assignments left enough room for customization and learning, but provided enough structure to keep us from getting too sidetracked. The lectures on Xcode and data structures were informative. Whiteboarding was more challenging, and a reasonable progression from the first whiteboarding exercise.
* Michael is an excellent instructor. He is easy to understand and has a mode of thoroughness that I find very helpful.
* Really enjoying the white boarding sessions. Quizzes are helpful. All instructional team have been stellar as usual.
* I highly appreciate data structures coverage during our sessions. This subject is not easy to understand and lectures are helping a lot. Also, I find whiteboarding a great way to internalize new material and improve one's proficiency in visualizing and communicating thought process. Reading on the topics covered in class was a good idea.
* I enjoy the live coding and the data structure lectures.
* I found the examples given in class to be very helpful. Especially when talking about certain concepts, using the whiteboard to either simplify and or create a visual explanation of topics. Linked lists would be the perfect example of something that was very well explained visually on the whiteboard.
* Whiteboarding and data structures, though stressful are super helpful. Lab and lecture time are also very helpful for learning.
* Accounts and social frameworks. Being able to tie in to an existing API is awesome, and I'm excited to use that on an app.

##WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?
* There was a moment where we were pressed for time during the live coding and because of it, there wasn't an explanation of what was being done. It was still good to see the order of operations, but there were some moments where it wasn't exactly clear.
* Still a little too much reading all the slides. Would rather have overview/synopsis during the lecture, followed with our questions for clarification. Especially since the slides are available for reference.
* Live coding in class moved so fast I'm not sure how much I got out of it. I suppose it's an important part of stacked learning, but I feel lost during the process.
* I understand it's the aspects of the program but it's always RUSH RUSH RUSH RUSH to learn everything.
* This past week, nothing of note has been unhelpful.
* None
* There needs to be more diversity in our guest speakers
* For our own white-boarding exercise on Friday, I found the direction and implementation to be somewhat unorganized. It was unclear what information should be assumed and what the potential applicant would be required to explain. I think that it would have been helpful to see a mock-whiteboard-interview between Adam and Michael. I did find a lot of value in seeing the limitations of what I can and cannot convey on the questions themselves. Additionally, when instructors are demoing what we need to do for our homework, it is often impossible to write as fast as the person is moving. I find myself getting stuck in limbo where I am trying to copy everything down in my notes that the person is doing while simultaneously trying to internalize the concepts and methodologies. Generally about 3/4 the way through I feel overwhelmed and completely stop writing and just watch. Perhaps slowing the pace, the amount of information given at once or having small 1-2min breaks scattered throughout would allow us time to keep up and digest the information given.
* Thursday lecture went REALLY REALLY fast and long. The pace was tough to keep up with.
* That last bit of code that we did on the day we went super long. Not because it was late for lunch, but because I feel like Adam was rushing through it to try to get us out of there faster. I'd rather go longer and make sure that the class is engaged and participating than try to follow Adam while he zooms through to try to get people out to lunch faster.

##DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?
* If pressed for time, I'd prefer spending a bit more time on the live coding over going over the lecture slides.
* Keep up the good work. Super happy with the program and learning a lot. Yes, there is always room for improvement, and I see movement in that direction.
* n/a
* I would like the readings to not be required at midnight, but required like right before class begins so I could submit my readings in the morning before class. It's frustrating that I'm there from 9 - 5 or 6, then need to go home and do a couple hours of reading before midnight so I can not be marked late on my reading submissions... and then also study all the extra things we're suggested to study.
* I'm not sure if Fridays could have their time utilized a little bit better, but last week Friday felt sort of like a give me in terms of a free day. A little bit less structured than Monday - Thursday which feels a bit awkward. I know we go over the game plan on Thursday, but I leave the class feeling like I didn't accomplish anything significant. It's difficult, because I enjoy having an easy day though!
* None
* None
* I think it would personally be helpful to provide more explicit names to variables, functions and especially parameters. Often times I find myself getting confused in code we are given that uses generic, repeating or partial indicators. Given the pace of the class and the amount of information we are exposed to, I think it would be easier to follow and grasp with careful attention to details in making the code as easy to read and follow as possible. One example might be in the linked list demonstration. The variables/identifiers "next" were often referenced but the word doesn't necessarily encapsulate what the significance of the value is. As a student, it would be helpful for me to see the names of these terms in what exactly they are in reference to. instead of "next" I might offer "nextNode" as we mean a pointer to the next complete object in a line of objects. Or instead of having two functions that are named "insert" and differ only in the parameters they take, we could be more explicit in naming based on the exact functionality. Perhaps "insertAtEnd" or "append" vs "insertAtIndex" or something.
* My concern is that I feel I am doggie paddling against a tsunami of information. And while I am putting in long hard days with studying the material and getting the work done, I just don't feel I have a solid foundation on anything. I am not sure if that is normal or imposter syndrome but it is a concern. I will keep going and doing the work regardless but that is a personal concern.
* Keep the level of class engagement high, even if we're running long.
